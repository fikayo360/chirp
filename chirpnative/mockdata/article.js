    articleBody:'The Lagos State All Progressives Congress has slammed the governorship candidate of Labour Party,Gbadebo Chinedu Rhodes Vivour over alleged threat to his life, while campaigning in Epe, east of the state.In a statement, Publicity secretary of the party Seye Oladejo described the allegation as irresponsible and a means to straw chasing.“It is not enough to allege, it’s more important to take measures to formally complain to the appropriate authorities over a matter as serious as a threat to life”, Oladejo said.He said Rhodes-Vivour needed to have lodged a complaint to the police, instead of resorting to media sensationalism.“There’s no doubt that resorting to media sensationalism is suspicious of the real intention of the allegedly threatened,” Oladejo said.For the umpteenth time, we need to reiterate that it is irresponsible politics to recklessly continue to heat up the polity in the name politicking by levelling allegations that could throw the general public into panic.',
